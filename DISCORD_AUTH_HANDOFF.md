# Discord Authentication Handoff Summary

## What We Accomplished Today

### Fixed the "Failed to fetch" Error âœ…
Started with a Discord Activity that showed "Failed to fetch" when clicking authorize. Through systematic debugging, we:

1. **Added CORS headers** to the Discord auth service
2. **Fixed nginx routing** to include Discord auth endpoints
3. **Discovered Discord's proxy behavior** - it strips `/api` prefix from paths
4. **Updated services to handle both paths**:
   - `/api/discord/token` (normal web usage)
   - `/discord/token` (Discord Activity proxy usage)

### Current State
- **Authentication works!** ðŸŽ‰
- Participants list loads
- No more fetch errors
- Just need to update UI to show authenticated user

### Key Learnings
1. Discord Activities use a proxy pattern: `/.proxy/api/discord/token`
2. The proxy strips the `/api` prefix, so requests arrive as `/discord/token`
3. Need to handle both routing patterns in nginx and backend services
4. Discord proxy mapping configuration: set to `/api` in Discord app settings

### Debugging Commands Used
```bash
# Check service logs
docker logs rpg-discord-auth --tail 50

# Check nginx logs  
docker logs rpg-nginx --tail 30

# View nginx config
docker exec rpg-nginx cat /etc/nginx/nginx-ssl.conf

# Check environment variables
docker exec rpg-discord-auth env | grep DISCORD
```

### Final Issue
Issue #36: UI doesn't update after successful authentication
- Auth succeeds but user state not populated
- See TODO comment in DiscordProvider.tsx line 117

## Next Session
Just need to update the DiscordProvider to properly set user state after authentication!
